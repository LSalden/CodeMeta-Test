This is a basic example which shows you how to generate a `codemeta.json` for an R package (e.g. for `testthat`):

```r
write_codemeta("testthat")
```

`codemetar` can take the path to the package root instead.  This may allow `codemetar` to glean some additional information that is not available from the description file alone.  

```{r}
codemetar::write_codemeta(find.package("codemetar"))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
library("magrittr")
"codemeta.json" %>%
  readLines() %>%
  details::details(summary = "codemetar's codemeta.json")
```

By default most often from within your package folder you'll simply run `codemetar::write_codemeta()`.

```{r echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
file.remove("codemeta.json")
```
