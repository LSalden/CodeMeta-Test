Dear CRAN Maintainers,

I am pleased to submit the codemetar package for generating codemeta.json files for R packages. Note that
this package uses the X-schema.org-* pattern as previously discussed abd recommended by CRAN maintainers (Kurt Hornik, Aug 27),
please let me know if this needs to be revised in any way. Thanks!

Sincerely,
Carl
