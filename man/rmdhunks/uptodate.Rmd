**How to keep codemeta.json up-to-date?** In particular, how to keep it up to date with `DESCRIPTION`? `codemetar` itself no longer supports automatic sync, but there are quite a few methods available out there.

* You could rely on `devtools::release()` since it will ask you whether you updated codemeta.json when such a file exists.

* You could use a git pre-commit hook that prevents a commit from being done if DESCRIPTION is newer than codemeta.json.

    * If that's your only pre-commit hook (i.e. you don't have one created by e.g. `usethis::use_readme_rmd()`), then you can create it using
    
```r
script = readLines(system.file("templates", "description-codemetajson-pre-commit.sh", package = "codemetar"))
usethis::use_git_hook("pre-commit",
                     script = script)
```

    * You can use the [precommit package](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/precommit).
    

* You could use GitHub actions.
